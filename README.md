# Linear Model Tree Decision Tree with Linear Models on Leaves

This repository contains the implementation of **Linear Tree Regression**—a machine learning approach that enhances decision trees by incorporating linear models at the leaf nodes. This project was my undergraduate thesis at Suleyman Demirel University in 2022, conducted in collaboration with Kunsulu Karayeva and supervised by Yernat Assylbekov.

## Overview  

Linear Model Trees combine the interpretability of Decision Trees with the predictive power of Linear Models. Our work focused on building and evaluating these models to demonstrate their advantages in regression and classification tasks.

## Key Features  
- **Decision Tree Implementation**: Built from scratch by following ([Sebastian Mantey’s tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6DmpG_PtN0&list=PLPOTBrypY74xS3WD0G_uzqPjCQfU6IRK-)).  
- **Linear Model Integration**: Enhanced Decision Trees by replacing standard leaf nodes with Linear Models.  
- **Comprehensive Experiments**: Tested on 8 datasets, comparing accuracy and computational cost against traditional Decision Trees.  
- **Performance Insights**: Found that Linear Trees significantly outperform Decision Trees, especially in regression tasks where they achieved the highest accuracy.  

## Key Findings  
- Linear Trees address the limitations of standalone Decision Trees and Linear Models by offering better accuracy and computational efficiency.  
- Linear Tree Regression consistently performed best across the datasets.
